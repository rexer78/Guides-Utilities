Sam Usefull Guides
this repository is a collection of guides, documents and links to other repos that are useful for my configurations.
I hope they will be as useful to others as they have been to me.

this is a link to a repo to monitor and publish on MQTT the information of a Raspberry 
(Memory CPU TEmperature etc ...)
